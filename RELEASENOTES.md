# New Features

## In-Room Staircases/Ladders

In intensity level 2 and higher the in-floor staircases/ladders that take you between tiles can now be shuffled with
any N/S connections. (those that appear to go up one floor are North connection and those that go down are South ones)

Big thanks to Catobat for doing all the hard work.
